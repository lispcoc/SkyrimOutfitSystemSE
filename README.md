# Skyrim Outfit System SE Revived

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/oxovhnk16gfn9ef3/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/thekineticeffect/skyrimoutfitsystemse-mpt1j/branch/master)

This mod is a resurrection of [aers's port](https://github.com/aers/SkyrimOutfitSystemSE) of David J Cobb's [Skyrim Outfit System](https://github.com/DavidJCobb/skyrim-outfit-system) for Skyrim SE.

This version now features a better Quickselect system using UIExtensions menus and is also version independent from the SKSE/Skyrim runtimes version by use of the [Address Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444). It has been tested on Skyrim runtimes 1.5.73 to 1.5.97.

# License

This mod is derived from aers's SSE port of DavidJCobb's Skyrim Outfit System. Since DavidJCobb originally licensed Skyrim Outfit System under 
CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0, which must be applied to derivative works, this rework also uses the same license.

Some files in the `dependencies` folder are from other places, and fall under their respective licenses.

# Building

## Prerequisites

Before attempting to build this project, please have the following tools installed.

 * Visual Studio 2019 with the C++ Toolchain
 * [CMake 3.15 or newer](https://cmake.org)
 * [vcpkg @ 2020.11-1](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/releases/tag/2020.11-1)
 * [ninja](https://ninja-build.org)
 * [Pyro](https://wiki.fireundubh.com/pyro)
 * git

## Build Steps

### Preparation

First, make sure this project is cloned and that the submodules are initialized and updated:

    git submodule update --init

This will download dependencies like `mapbox` and my custom fork of CommonLibSSE.

You must also manually download SKSE64 2.0.15. Extract it into the `dependencies/skse64` subfolder. You want it such that `skse64_readme.txt` is directly inside of `dependencies/skse64`.

Make sure you have an installation of the exact version of `vcpkg` specified above bootstrapped and ready to go. The version of `vcpkg` determines the versions of the dependencies that will be provided by it.

### Building the C++ Plugin

You will use CMake to build this project. This project is 64-bit statically linked and uses vcpkg to get some dependencies. 

Make sure to activate the x86-64 build tools as as follows:

    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x86_amd64

First, create a build folder (anywhere is fine). For this example, we will create a folder called `build` inside the root of the project.

`cd` into this build folder. Invoke CMake as follows:

    cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${PATH TO VCPKG TOOLCHAIN} -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static ../

Note that `${PATH TO VCPKG TOOLCHAIN}` is supposed to be replaced with the path to the `vkpkg` toolchain, and described by the [vcpkg documentation](https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/integration/).

 > **NOTE:** This command may fail the first time, saying that "protoc.exe" could not be found. If this happens, rerun the cmake command above.

Once the project is successfully configured, build it by running

    ninja -j

 > **NOTE:** `ninja` is the only supported build tool. MSBuild may or may not work.

In a few moments, you should have `SkyrimOutfitSystemSE.dll` in the `mod_files` folder.

### Building the Papyrus code

This project uses Pyro to build the Papyrus scripts. Pyro uses the `skyrimse.ppj` file in the root of this project. I personally use the [VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joelday.papyrus-lang-vscode) for this, but I plan to add instructions on doing it manually.

## Assembling the Mod Package

The CMake and Pyro build process both deposit their build artifacts into the `mod_files` folder. This folder also contains the translation file and `.esp` file and, when both the Papyrus and C++ plugins are built, is the complete mod package.
